app/
features/
components/
services/

```

Business logic is isolated from the UI.

Components are reusable.

Data fetching is abstracted through Services and TanStack Query.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text

## 📂 Mock API

The application uses a local Mock API implemented with Next.js Route Handlers.

Available endpoints:

```http
GET /api/stores

GET /api/stores/:id

GET /api/products

GET /api/regions

GET /api/overview
```

All responses are validated using Zod before being consumed by the application.

## 📊 Data Model

The application uses a normalized domain model.

```text
Store

```

Dashboard metrics are calculated dynamically.

No derived values are persisted.
